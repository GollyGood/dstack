# hipsnip-solr

Chef cookbook for setting up Apache Solr 3.6.x/4.x from mirrors.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hipsnip-cookbooks/solr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hipsnip-cookbooks/solr) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/hipsnip-cookbooks/solr.png)](https://gemnasium.com/hipsnip-cookbooks/solr)

## Requirements

Built to run on Linux distributions. Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.
Depends on the `hipsnip-jetty` cookbook.

## Usage

For example if you want to install Solr 4.2, you could create a cookbook with a recipe containing this code:

    node.set['solr']['version'] = '4.2.1'
    node.set['solr']['checksum'] = '648a4b2509f6bcac83554ca5958cf607474e81f34e6ed3a0bc932ea7fac40b99'

    node.set['jetty']['port'] = 8983
    node.set['jetty']['version'] = '9.0.2.v20130417'
    node.set['jetty']['link'] = 'http://eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/jetty/stable-9/dist/jetty-distribution-9.0.2.v20130417.tar.gz&r=1'
    node.set['jetty']['checksum'] = '6ab0c0ba4ff98bfc7399a82a96a047fcd2161ae46622e36a3552ecf10b9cddb9'

    include_recipe 'hipsnip-solr'


> NOTE: Jetty 9 now requires Java 1.7 to be installed. However, the Opscode Java cookbook we use installs version 1.6 by default. To change the version of Java being installed, you'll need to put the following in your Role or Environment config file:

    {
      "default_attributes": {
        "java" : {
          "jdk_version" : 7
        }
      }
    }


For more usage examples, have a look at the recipes in `test/cookbooks/hipsnip-solr_test/recipes/`.

## Cookbook development

You will need to do a couple of things to be up to speed to hack on this cookbook.
Everything is explained [here](https://github.com/hipsnip-cookbooks/cookbook-development) have a look.
