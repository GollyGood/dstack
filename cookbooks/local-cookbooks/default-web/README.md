default-web
===========

The default-web cookbook is a simple cookbook implementation for setting up
development sites based on the `sites` attribute from the configuration file.
This cookbook will not only set-up and configure Apache2 for http sites, but
also https sites, and MySQL databases for the specified sites.
This cookbook may either be used as is or copied to create a custom site
cookbook for setting up sites however is required.

For additional information for creating sites via configuration see the
[configuration documentation](../../../documentation/configuration.md#sites).
